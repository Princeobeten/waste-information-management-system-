3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different interfaces and permissions for users and administrators
4. **Notification System**: Real-time updates on service request status
5. **RESTful API Design**: Well-structured endpoints for data operations
6. **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly interface for universal access

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation serves multiple purposes:
- For developers: Understanding system architecture and code organization
- For administrators: System requirements and management procedures
- For academic submission: Meeting project documentation requirements
- For future development: Recommendations for system enhancements

## Technical Details

The documentation aligns with the implemented codebase and includes:
- Database schema definitions matching our MongoDB models
- API endpoints corresponding to actual route implementations
- User interface descriptions matching our React components
- Hardware and software requirements for development and production environments
- Flowcharts representing the actual system logic

## Next Steps
